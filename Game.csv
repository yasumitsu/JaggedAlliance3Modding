I was told this country is Morocco but it was not and no one compensated me for it being the wrong country! And after that things got only worse. I have created a list of my current complaints:

<bullet_point> No one was speaking American.
<bullet_point> The refugee camp where I was forcefully relocated was a 1-star establishment at best.
<bullet_point> The camp was open to all nationalities. I wanted to be placed in an American camp, but a person had the gall to inform me there was no such thing. I am shocked and scandalized.
<bullet_point> I was robbed of my passport and belongings and no one compensated me for my worries. In fact, there did not seem to be a manager anywhere. After I tried to contact the government, they informed me that their manager is missing. The audacity of these people!
<bullet_point> After my passport was returned, I was not compensated with a first-class seat on the plane. I was even told there is no first class in cargo planes. I have written to the manager of the company but I still have received no response. These people value no one's time!

All in all this is turning worse than my last vacation where I wanted to go to Acapulco and ended up in a place called Arulco. Such uncivilized people.

I wish to be compensated for my troubles and all persons responsible are to be fired immediately!

370360776722,"Salutations,

This email will serve as a temporary contract for your services to <em>Adonis</em>. This is necessary for us to provide the payment I have promised to you on behalf of Emma LaFontaine. As you may notice, it isn't stipulating any details about the nature of your services. Any specific work that has not already been agreed upon will be covered in additional agreements that we will sign later as the need arises.

In short, you are expected to establish control over <em>diamond mines</em> on the mainland and to deal with any persons or organizations who are illegally possessing/operating them. Adonis has an exclusive contract to own and operate these mines, so please ensure they are in working order and adequately staffed and managed.

In return, you will be paid daily per mine based on their diamond output. I advise you to earn the <em>Loyalty</em> and support of the local populace, as this will dramatically affect each mine's productivity and proportionally increase the diamond yield (i.e., profits).

As a sign of good will, I'm wiring you an <em>advance payment</em>. However, I expect you will soon need to start establishing control over diamond mines to secure a steady income in order to pay for and maintain the full effectiveness of your team in the field. My suggestion is to charter a boat from Ernie and travel ASAP to the mainland. You will find on your digital map the coordinates of the specific diamond mines where you are expected to perform the services outlined above.

Also, I will send your way any intelligence we have about illegal <em>diamond shipments</em> in the region. If you are able to intercept some of those, we will gladly compensate you for the effort.

Good luck.

389618997129,"<em>BREAKING NEWS: HUNDREDS KILLED IN REFUGEE CAMP MASSACRE</em>

Hundreds of refugees have been killed in an unprecedented attack in the troubled Adjani River Valley of Grand Chien. This is the heaviest incident of civilian casualties in the country since the civil war several years ago. The region is still unstable after the disappearance of Grand Chien's president <em>Alphonse LaFontaine</em> during his visit to the Adjani.

Asked who is responsible for the attack, <em>Col. Faucheux</em> of the Army of Grand Chien revealed that it was committed by international paramilitary groups known as <em>M.E.R.C.</em> and <em>A.I.M.</em> The Colonel stated that a large detachment of Grand Chien's army has been tasked with saving the President and restoring order in the region. He is determined to make the guilty parties pay a ""heavy price"" for the atrocities.

***

This is what reached the world news. The local TV is way worse - they call you fascists and monsters, and scream for vengeance. I watched an interview with <em>Colonel Faucheux</em> and he was blaming you for literally everything that is wrong in our country. I don't like that man. I remember when I went to him and begged him to do something to save my father. He told me they were doing everything they could, and that there was a ""special operation for saving him, don't you worry your pretty little head"".

Who talks like that?!

And now he doesn't even answer my calls, and neither does <em>Corazon Santiago</em>. I think we cannot trust her anymore. I heard about troop movements of Adonis security forces that cooperated with the Grand Chien army. I don't know the details. Some of my friends in government have gone silent, and I'm worried there is some plot in motion here.

This country needs its <em>President</em> now more than ever. I fear that if he doesn't return very soon, there will be another civil war. I don't know what part the <em>Major</em> plays in all this, but I have learned that his camp is far in the Northeast - the <em>Eagle's Nest</em>. My father is being kept there. Please save him before it's too late!

I think you can't rely on Adonis for payment anymore. It was difficult to get alternative funding for you, but I managed to make an arrangement with local administrators to help you run the <em>diamond mines</em> you control. My father will owe them some favors, but as long as you succeed in rescuing him... Well, that's all that matters.

That's all I've got for now. I wish you luck with all my heart!

I'm back at the <em>capital</em>. I'm trying to organize the funeral for my poor father... It is a terrible mess here - there is fighting on the streets and explosions every now and again. The people loyal to my father managed to get the army units garrisoning the capital under control, but some of the generals elsewhere in the country have turned against us and sent forces to try and occupy the city.

We are under siege. People are talking, and they are very much divided in their opinions. Many believe that you are responsible for the <em>Refugee Camp Massacre</em>. There are lies and exaggerations about you everywhere. They say that my father was a traitor who handed over all of the diamond mines in Grand Chien to you, and then you killed him. I am pretty sure that <em>Corazon Santiago</em> is behind that smear campaign, but I cannot prove anything.

We desperately need the truth. <em>Santiago</em> and her machinations with <em>Faucheux</em> need to be exposed. You have to find <em>evidence</em> against them. This will help <em>clear your name</em> and show our people that they have been deceived.

<em>Adonis director suddenly resigns</em> 
  
Corazon Santiago, Director of Operations for Adonis corp. has suddenly resigned according to Daily Chienne sources. The decision left many on the board of Adonis flummoxed as it was considered a safe bet that Corazon will be the next CEO of Adonis. There is little information about the whys of the resignation with the official statement citing ""personal reasons"". 
  
Corazon was leading the Adonis expansion to Grand Chien, first as assistant to then CEO Mike Ditch and later as director of operations after his disappearance. She pushed hard for legislation that would give Adonis exclusive mining rights to Grand Chien's natural resources which would lead to a de facto monopoly over the diamond mining sector. 
  
<em>The controversy around Santiago</em> 
  
One potential reason why Corazon has resigned may be the flurry of scandals around her in recent weeks. Adonis was accused of financing the Major and his Legion while the infamous paramilitary organization was still in its infancy. She was also accused of meddling in Grand Chien politics through her contacts with Col. Jules Faucheux of the Grand Chien army. A cabinet secretary has even suggested that the two are ""romantically involved"". 
  
Adonis has vehemently denied all of the accusations, but the umbrage of bad press is bound to continue with Corazon's sudden departure. Whether the scandals have had any bearing on her decision is yet to be seen. However, in the world of corporate politics the public image is everything. 
  
<em>The Daily Chienne's ""Female Leaders"" conference canceled, keynote speaker still missing</em> 
  
With a heavy heart, we must cancel our first ""Female Leaders"" conference due to the disappearance of Petta Waters, the keynote speaker. Petta had arrived earlier in Grand Chien with the idea of creating a natural reserve where ""the rights of every animal should be preserved and respected"". Unfortunately, we are still to receive a word of Petta's current location ever since she announced her intention to acquire hyena specimens for the habitat. 
  
The Daily Chienne hopes that Petta Waters is alive and well and will soon return and continue with her plans for the ""Democratic society of animals and humans"".

<em>Something good for once</em>

The Creutzfeldt-Jakob Sanatorium is organizing a massive blood drive. If the initiative is successful, medical experts believe that up to five thousand people that would have otherwise died in hospital due to a lack of blood for transfusions may be saved this year alone. All volunteers will be compensated until the initiative runs out of budget. Several international NGOs are backing the drive and it is expected to run for months with the current rate of participation.

If you are in the area of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Sanatorium, please take some time to visit and donate blood. Your child, relative, or loved one may one day depend on the blood you give today.

<em>A new disease?</em>

To somewhat temper the good news, there are reports of a new disease spreading throughout the jungle region of the Adjani dubbed ""Red Rabies"". The disease is reportedly a less lethal, more virulent variation of the rabies virus. In layman's terms, the infected become completely irrational and aggressive lacking any self-control and attacking on sight.

Dr. Kronenberg at the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Sanatorium claims the disease is a hoax (this was corroborated by the physician in Chalet De La Paix, the only big settlement in the area). Can one hope that at least one bad thing may spare us? I certainly hope so - with all the conflicts and strife this country has been through, the last thing we need is a disease outbreak, especially from a disease causing more violence.

<em>Rumors galore</em>

If the disease rumors turn out to be a hoax, this will not be the first wild rumor flying around. Let's start with the rumors of a ghost in the Abandoned Mansion of former Adonis CEO, Mike Ditch. These stories have circulated for years but since the mansion has been overtaken by the Legion, they have gained new legs and sprinted their way through a gullible population hungry for sensationalism.
A ""witch"" is supposed to live in Wassergrab, doing sexual rituals to the men in the area to keep her youth. Apparently, these people have invented a novel way of explaining absences to their wives after visiting a brothel. Most of these rumors sound bizarre, but perhaps I'd like to think there is a modicum of truth to every such rumor.

A more sinister tale is the cult of the \""Old Ones\"" in Chalet De La Paix. Not only has the cult damaged a lot of the Borassus plants in the area, but it appears they are also into animal sacrifice (and even human sacrifice, according to unsubstantiated claims by the local physician).

I always like to think there is a modicum of truth to these rumors but as we are understaffed, we cannot investigate further. For now, follow our newsletter where we give you real facts and real journalism. Our integrity is impeccable. (We apologize for the unsubstantiated claim that there are secret government bio laboratories - we have fired the intern responsible for that unfortunate story.)

<em>Legion loses ground</em>

In a stunning turn of events, we have eyewitness reports claiming Ernie Island is no longer under Legion control. After reports of fighting on the island following the execution of one Tinhay Mercedes, it appears the Legion has lost its main stronghold located in Fort l'Eau Bleu. So far, we have conflicting reports of who now controls the island with some reports stating a local militia has overthrown the Legion, while others claim unknown paramilitary forces are to blame (see below).

<em>Multiple Reports of paramilitary mercenary groups in Grand Chien</em>

There is a huge surge of reported sightings of mercenary squads in Grand Chien. In the last month alone, we have received eyewitness accounts of heavily armed foreign forces around the Great Savanna, Ernie Island and various other locations. Our anonymous sources claim the sightings are real and are part of Adonis Corporation's pledge to protect its interests in the country. So far, Adonis is declining any further comments, instead issuing a blanket statement that they will do their utmost to protect their personnel and assets in Grand Chien.

<em>Kerfuffle at the Carnival</em>

In an amusing local news story, the events of the Carnival of Love in Pantagruel were marred by the appearance of armed forces. Reports of the following events differ greatly, but it appears a mercenary force was trying to fight or infiltrate Carnival.

What followed was a scene of carnage and drug infused mayhem - over thirty carts were tipped, multiple girls groped without permission or payment, and fireworks or explosives unleashed. Since this is pretty standard fare as far as Carnival goes, the locals were amused instead of perturbed - until it was discovered that the Carnival Queen herself had gone missing.
""The foreigners are now taking not only the great riches of this land, but its women too!"", a local was heard saying.

<em>Leader of atrocities committee presumed dead</em>

Colonel Jules Faucheux has gone missing and is presumed dead. Information about the subject is scarce, but there are reports about the colonel's compound being attacked by unknown paramilitary forces.

Jules Faucheux was a divisive figure in Grand Chien politics. He cemented his power by supporting President LaFontaine in the country's first democratic elections after the civil war, but was often at loggerheads with his commander-in-chief. His firm belief in force rather than dialogue alienated him from the more liberal supporters of the President's party, causing a permanent rift in the government.

Had he completed his goal of capturing the foreign agents he proclaimed as responsible for the Refugee Camp Massacre, many feel he would have become a de facto leader of the country in the absence of Alphonse LaFontaine.

<em>Rumors abound about the missing Colonel</em>

The disappearance of the colonel gave rise to a number of rumors about his person and his political agenda. Many feel that his ties with Adonis mean he had an ongoing agreement with the corporation offering them a monopoly over the country's mining resources, in return for political and military support. This theory is corroborated by a Faucheux secretary claiming the existence of hidden coded communication between Adonis and Col. Faucheux.

Others have pointed out that his detachment is the only military unit in the region that had access to chemical weapons, and he should be the one that is investigated. These rumors will only gain credence now that the colonel is no longer in power and the government may take closer look into the missing colonel's private affairs.

<em>Grand Chien art world shocked - new private collection emerges</em>

The small but vocal art critic society of Grand Chien was shocked to discover an extensive private collection suddenly put on auction late last week.

""Some of the works are priceless and were thought to be lost forever"", a stunned critic commented.

<em>Legion losing ground in the Fleatown area</em>

Legion continues to lose ground. This time Fleatown is the scene of battle as another Legion force has been routed. There is little information about what has actually occurred, but all sources confirm that at least part of the city has been freed from Legion forces. 

Are foreign forces deliberately seeking to supplant the strongest paramilitary force in the region? We are currently investigating claims of a small elite force thrashing Legion forces in its way. More on this story as it unfolds.

<em>Fleatown - unruly and poverty-stricken</em>

Fleatown has always been an unruly place even under the rule of the Legion. With all the ongoing turf wars and the ubiquitous poverty, it is often cited as one of Grand Chien's crime hotspots. Just a few weeks prior to the current battles, a midday shootout happened at the market.

It appears a foreign teenager got into hot water with a local thug gang and suddenly shots were fired. The local authorities claim it was just a misunderstanding over a girl, but our reports show that at least one person was killed in the shootout. The quick reaction by community leaders such as Father Tooker and the underground kingpin Boss Blaubert himself stopped the shootout from escalating further, but such events are commonplace in Fleatown.

It is unlikely that in the current era of instability Fleatown's fortune would improve. The gangs offer the youths of the city a quick way to riches, and the Legion - a quick way to vent their anger. The few remaining good seeds leave the city to seek their fortune in Port Cacao or abroad. 
Perhaps one day we will have a government that may lead Fleatown and Grand Chien out of the pit, but for now, the future looks dark.

<em>The House of Blessed Spirits</em>

What does it cost to save your soul - a question posed by many philosophers, intellectuals, and clergy. A local priest by the name of Father Tooker has an unusual answer - diamonds. 

Tooker is an unusual breed - a mountain of a man that looks more likely to rob you than save you, a clergyman and, at the same time, a firm believer in superstitions prevalent across Grand Chien. When asked how both combine, the Father just shrugs his shoulders and claims he sees no difference between the two. After years of failing to keep his church financially stable and keep the locals out of trouble, Tooker took a more pragmatic approach - pay for your way to heaven.

The church allows everyone who donates a diamond or cash to the Church a blessing and absolution of all sins. According to Father Tooker, all proceeds are returned to the community which is at least partially corroborated by the community - soup is widely distributed to the poor in the area even if the contents are more than questionable.

Is this ""patron saint of diamonds"" as clear as the stones he asks of his parishioners? 
It is hard to make moral judgements in a town like Fleatown. He is at least trying to do something in a city that both the government and God have abandoned long ago. I have seen with my own eyes that the church wall was damaged, and I hope that the sums Father Tooker has gathered will be sufficient to repair this daring attempt at sacral architecture.

<em>Legion executes local on Ernie Island</em>

The Legion's cold grip on the heart of the nation does not seem to be relenting with a reported execution in the small town of Ernie, located off the southern coast of Grand Chien. We have received reports that a local was dragged from his home and killed in the center of town for ""insubordination to the Legion"". It appears that the lofty goals of the Legion certainly do not match their methods.

<em>Further clashes near Pantagruel</em>

Communist militias have clashed once again with Legion forces. Both sides blame each other for the hostilities and vow for revenge. Meanwhile, the Army continues its policy of non-interference, no doubt waiting for both groups to exhaust each other's supplies and will to fight. As usual, there was no comment from the government related to the recent events.

<em>Questions abound as President still missing</em>

It has been multiple days since the abduction of President LaFontaine by the Legion forces. While the Legion has publicly made several statements indicating they have the President, state officials are refusing to comment on the President's whereabouts and potential Legion involvement.

There are several anti-Legion protests in throughout the country, but so far little has changed in the life of the ordinary citizens. We will continue to monitor the situation as more information comes to light.

<em>Mining exports from Grand Chien expected to plummet</em>

As the political situation in Grand Chien continues to unravel, there are fears that the mining operations on the island will ground to a halt. Adonis, one of the few remaining corporations still doing business in the region, has publicly commented that they have taken ""all possible measures"" to ensure that their mines are still operational.

Rumors are, the Legion controls most diamond mines but is losing ground to a faction or factions unknown. We will continue to follow this story closely.

<em>""We will not wage a war, but we will protect our assets and personnel"" vows Adonis representative</em>

In a recent interview with the Daily Chienne, Adonis representative Corazon Santiago has reiterated that they will use force to protect their mining operation from the threat of the Legion and other rebel groups. While Adonis officially denies interference in the growing conflict in Grand Chien, it is strongly suspected they are bringing in armed mercenary squads from abroad with orders to subdue the Legion.

<em>Crocodile attacks on the rise. Farmers panic</em>

Crocodile attacks are at an all-time high this year. Crocodile-related accidents are threatening the livelihood of farmers in the swampier regions of Grand Chien, causing much discontent in the nation. ""Rebels, Legion, and now crocodiles. We have been abandoned by God"", said a local through tears as half of his herd was eaten during the last month. Lead scientists claim that the recent climate change may have caused a crocodile population boom, which would explain the increased number of violent attacks. Locals remain skeptical, saying that the weather is not much different from last year and ""them bigwigs from the University can eat our shorts if the crocs don't get us first"".

<em>Pantagruel free from the Legion for now</em>

In a surprising statement from the local Maquis forces, it appears they have taken control of the city of Pantagruel. This is surprising, as the battles over the city were in a longstanding stalemate with little hope of either side managing to gain an advantage. It is unclear what has tipped the balance in favor of the Maquis (apart from the claims that communism will always succeed in the end), but the locals tell of additional armed forces under no banner that joined the fray.

Will Maqui control of the city continue or will the Legion regroup to take back the city? Only the future holds the answers at this point.

<em>Maquis prisoners</em>

Numerous reports of a number of Maquis taken prisoners by Legion forces have emerged with the liberation of Pantagruel. Local Maqui forces are furious as their comrades are still held captive and no rescue operation is planned as of yet with the precarious state of the city.

""They are our brothers and sisters! The Legion has no right to keep them captive, which only proves their corrupt capitalist ways!"" is a popular sentiment among the local fighters.

Curiously, a new local myth of a communist superhero nicknamed ""The Unyielding"" is keeping the pressure in check. According to the whispers, that alleged superhero is able to withstand any torture and is a shining beacon for all proper communists. While there is little to support this story, it has soothed the fears of the Maquis about the fate of their comrades.

""If the Unyielding is left unbroken, our brothers and sisters will be safe. We must persevere as communism will surely defeat capitalism in the end"" said a happy soldier by the name of Anne.

<em>A night at Le Lys Rouge</em>
<flavor>Paid article></flavor>

I was offered a free night at Le Lys Rouge - one of Pantagruel's highlights, according to some. The establishment called by many a brothel is slightly more expensive than its competitors, but sports a modicum of cleanliness rarely seen in such quarters. The clients seemed happy with the services rendered and the drinks are more decent than one would expect.

Le Lys Rouge has three-tiered system of services called ""Look, Touch, and More"". I was able to sample only the first two tiers before feeling the urge to vacate the premises and can assure you they offer exactly what it says on the tin.

While Le Lys Rouge is not for everybody (this reporter included), it remains an institution in Pantagruel that is worth the visit even if for the drinks alone.

<em>Port Cacao lost</em>

Legion forces have occupied Port Cacao. The ineffectual defense forces under the command of Gouverneur Le Pingouin were quickly routed and could only evacuate the Gouverneur and his family. There was strong resistance by former members of the Coffee Beans gang, but their efforts were not well coordinated,and they could not hold the city for long.

This is a dark day in our history. Port Cacao has been a shining example of what a city could be. This loss may also be the loss of our spirit and hope for better days.

<em>Statement from Gouverneur Le Pingouin</em>

""""My fellow citizens, I must inform you that the city of Port Cacao is now controlled by the Legion. Let me reassure you that both me and my wife are safe at the moment thanks to our brave forces.

I have imposed the strongest of sanctions and condemned the Legion for this outrageous discourtesy to our city and to me personally. No one could have foreseen this turn of events, or we would have been better prepared. I personally blame the government and different military organizations that did NOTHING to defend us from the Legion.

Still with the sanctions in place, I am confident that the Legion will see the error of their ways and cede all Port Cacao territories within days. Our spirits remain high, and we send our thoughts and prayers to all that give their lives for our safety.""""

<em>Remembering Madam Lecoq</em>

Continuing our stories of women who shaped Grand Chien, we will be focusing on Madam Lecoq. A staunch believer in women's equality (and sometimes superiority), she pushed for women's rights in unorthodox but effective ways.

Madam Lecoq, or Bethany as was her given name, was a poor girl from a village close to Pantagruel. Her father was one of the first members of the Maqui movement and little is known about her mother, but it is believed that she was a prostitute who passed away while giving birth to Bethany.

Bethany was exceptionally clever, beautiful and vain, according to her classmates. """"A precocious child"""" is how her teachers described her at the time. Bethany felt stifled at a school where only boys were meant to continue past eight grade. This school policy was abandoned by the school headmaster in what appears to be a combination of shaming and blackmail by a teenage Bethany and her friends.

After school, Bethany found herself in the unique situation of being the only woman in Pantagruel who could perform mathematical operations. She started an accounting business to help local prostitutes who felt they were being shortchanged by their clients and pimps. It is at this point that Bethany adopted the moniker Madam Lecoq, as many of the girls felt safer working for her than for a man.

Madam Lecoq's wealth quickly increased and she started some local development projects, including the current building of Le Lys Rouge and a trust fund to build a clinic in the city of Pantagruel, (unfortunately, due to a lot of red tape by the then Mayor Le Pingouin the project was held back and the """"Vulture of Hope"""" never did open on time).

Madam Lecoq was a major political player in Grand Chien, although she was never part of a political party or movement. Her influence was subtle but effective - many women's rights laws were created soon after she was seen leaving a politician's office or home. Her greatest accomplishment is probably orchestrating a cease fire during the civil war, that eventually lead to ending the war.

Unfortunately, Madam Lecoq never saw the end of the war. Her health deteriorated and she was not able to receive proper health care due to the lack of medical facilities in Pantagruel. Up until her last days, she would organize huge parties befitting of her lavish lifestyle. Her collection of chairs, her establishment and her political endeavors will forever remain a part of her legacy.

<em>Legion forces amassing for attack on Port Cacao</em>

There is evidence of the Legion preparing for a massive attack on Port Cacao. The so-called ""N-Night"" military operation is already in preparation and there is little hope the city will remain free. Local officials are vehemently downplaying the threat commenting that this must be a military exercise or a ruse.

""There is absolutely no chance the city will be attacked. The potential repercussions for the Legion will be so severe that they will not dare to even consider an attack. They must just be doing military exercises to keep themselves busy"", commented Gouverneur Le Pingouin.

<em>President LaFontaine's daughter petitions for Museum of the Adjani</em>

Emma LaFontaine has officially petitioned Gouverneur Le Pingouin for a new museum dedicated to the rich history of the Adjani region.

""This is our history. This is the history of the world. This place has so many artifacts, so many stories to tell. Even if we uncover only a few, there will be nowhere to store and present them safely. How can we call ourselves a nation if we do not preserve our rich history? If we do not show to the world we are more than civil wars and perpetual conflict?"", reads the petition.

While the time for a museum is long overdue, there is little chance that the thick wall of red tape can be breached. Gouverneur Le Pingouin is notorious for creating bureaucratic obstacles to any and all motions that require him to do more than talk (a fact vehemently contested by the Gouverneur). So, unless a miracle pushes the petition into action somehow, this will be just another document like many others that will be lying in the archives of Port Cacao.

<em>Remembering Ma Baxter</em>

As part of our series of exploring the lives of female leaders of Grand Chien, we will be focusing today on the legendary Ma Baxter. Instrumental in turning Port Cacao into the city it is today, Baxter comes from humble origins - a daughter of a seamstress and a sailor.

Ma Baxter quickly rose to prominence during her teenage years by forming the Coffee Beans - part gang, part militia, a force the embodies the heart and soul of Grand Chien - tenacity, violence, and grit. Her gang slowly but steadily removed all major gangs in the area by (often excessive) force. Using her father's connections, she quickly got into the weapons trade thus arming her gang and as a legitimate business venture still active to this day.

Ma Baxter and her shotgun kept the peace in Port Cacao for as long as she lived. Her influence is still felt, mostly by the virtually non-existent crime rate in a city as bad as Fleatown in its heyday. My own grandmother often threatened me that she will go and call the Coffee Beans if I did not behave and eat my soup. A threat so effective, I still loathe soup to this day.

Her son Gregory (dubbed ""Lurch"" by the locals) tried to follow in her footsteps and form his own gang, but a headshot accident ironically ended his headhunter career. Ma Baxter fell ill and passed away soon after.

A woman of great spirit that made the Adjani a better place with just a strong word, her pure charisma and a shotgun, Ma Baxter has her rightful place in the hall of fame of Grand Chien. Ma Baxter and her legendary shotgun have put many on the path to good - both a villain and a hero, she will forever remain a threat that any grandmother can use to set her unruly grandchildren straight.

It is at this point that Bethany adopted the moniker Madam Lecoq, as many of the girls felt safer working for her than for a man.

Madam Lecoq's wealth quickly increased and she started some local development projects, including the current building of Le Lys Rouge and a trust fund to build a clinic in the city of Pantagruel, (unfortunately, due to a lot of red tape by the then Mayor Le Pingouin the project was held back and the ""Vulture of Hope"" never did open on time).

Madam Lecoq was a major political player in Grand Chien, although she was never part of a political party or movement. Her influence was subtle but effective - many women's rights laws were created soon after she was seen leaving a politician's office or home. Her greatest accomplishment is probably orchestrating a cease fire during the civil war, that eventually lead to ending the war.

Unfortunately, Madam Lecoq never saw the end of the war. Her health deteriorated and she was not able to receive proper health care due to the lack of medical facilities in Pantagruel. Up until her last days, she would organize huge parties befitting of her lavish lifestyle. Her collection of chairs, her establishment and her political endeavors will forever remain a part of her legacy.

<em>President LaFontaine found dead at Eagle's Nest camp</em>

It is a sad day for our country as our beloved president Alphonse was found dead at a Legion camp in the mountains. The news was confirmed by Emma LaFontaine, the president's daughter. The news were received with shock and fear among the political elite. It seems that an era has passed, and the future looks uncertain and scary.

Looks like Grand Chien is about to become even more fragmented, and all factions in Parliament are preparing for a long and gruesome political struggle. We will continue to monitor the battle for this country's soul, report only verified information and follow the truth to the end.

<em>Statement from Emma LaFontaine</em>

""Friends, it is with the greatest of grief that I must inform you that my father, President Alphonse LaFontaine, is dead. He was a father to me but also a father to us all as citizens of Grand Chien. President LaFontaine's life was devoted to our country, and I will not let his sacrifice go in vain. Even though I will never be able to fill my late father's shoes, I will continue to follow his course and lead our nation to its rightful place among the civilized democratic societies.
Remember my father.
Remember his fight was also your fight.
With a pure heart and an open mind, we will overcome all obstacles.""

<em>Legion forces in shambles</em>

There are multiple reports from military and political sources that the Legion forces are currently in disarray. The loss of their trump card - the kidnapped President, has undoubtedly shaken the paramilitary organization, but some sources claim that the warlord at the head of the Legion, the Major himself, has gone missing.

While too early to tell, the shocking events of last week may be a sign that the reign of violence in this country is finally coming to an end. But is only for a new era of violence to start? This reporter does not have an answer.

<em>President LaFontaine returns</em>

In a stunning turn of events, kidnapped President LaFontaine just walked back into office, stunning both party officials and the security at the presidential palace. There is little information about this turn of events, and speculations are running wild. Swirling in the vortex of Grand Chien's political life, are rumors about foreign involvement, a deal between the Major and the presidential daughter, Emma LaFontaine, or even theories that Alphonse LaFontaine was not even kidnapped in the first place.

Of course, the Daily Chienne will only print verified accounts of the events, so for now we are eagerly awaiting more information.

<em>Statement from President Alphonse LaFontaine</em>

""My fellow citizens, I have returned. My kidnapping and rescue will undoubtedly be a subject to numerous investigations, but for now I want to ensure one and all of you that I am back. This country is no longer leaderless and no matter what our enemies throw at us, we will return stronger and with even greater resolve to make Grand Chien a modern functioning country.""

568174478235,"Brace yourselves, everyone! This is a hard newsletter both to write and to read, due to the recent atrocities committed at the Refugee Camp.

<em>Number of casualties soars in wake of chemical weapons attack</em>

The unthinkable has happened. The last shred of civility in battle was torn as a heinous attack on civilians occurred last week. The number of casualties is rapidly increasing, with officials warning it could potentially reach into hundreds. This reporter has never thought something like this could happen in her lifetime and hopes it never will. 

May the souls of the dead rest in peace.

<em>Grand Chien wants answers and punishment</em>

The attack caused an unseen before unity among all political factions (except for the Legion) who condemned the attack and urged the army to intervene. Colonel Jules Faucheux has been tasked with forming an investigative body to collect evidence about the attack and bring the culprits to court.

President loyalists screamed for the task force to also investigate the source of the chemical weapons, but this was overruled based on the urgency of the situation. One army general even called this treason and accused the liberals of braying instead of kicking when a call to action is needed. That at least was a reminder that no matter how big an atrocity is, our leaders will always find something to argue about.

<em>Statement from Col. Faucheux regarding the incident</em>

""We must be swift in punishing the foreigners responsible for this or it will tear our country apart. Alphonse LaFontaine's liberal policies, while good in principle, have made our country seem weak, allowing undesirable foreign elements to exploit our seeming weakness. This is a time for action, and we will act! ""

Col. Faucheux also said that there is ""veritable"" evidence that the foreigners are working with the Legion to disrupt the mining operations in the country and hurt Grand Chien's only significant export. Corazon Santiago, Adonis' director of operations, was also seen at the press event and commented that Adonis is going to bring in additional forces to Grand Chien and use them to assist the army in their investigation. ""We must take a stand when people are massacred. These are our workers, our friends that got hurt in the Refugee Camp. We will commit as many resources as needed for the Colonel to complete his task.""

Below you can find my grandma's original onion soup recipe

Ingredients:

4-5 large onions, sliced
4 tablespoons of butter
1 tablespoon of sugar
4 tablespoons of all-purpose flour
6 cups of beef broth
1/2 cup of dry white wine
1 bay leaf
1 sprig of fresh thyme
salt and pepper
1 baguette, sliced
1 cup of grated Gruyere cheese

Instructions:

1. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté for 10 minutes.
2. Add the sugar and cook the onions until they are caramelized and soft, stirring occasionally. This should take another 20-30 minutes.
3. Add the flour to the pot and stir it in, cooking for an additional 2-3 minutes.
4. Add the beef broth, white wine, bay leaf and thyme sprig to the pot. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes.
6. While the soup is simmering, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Place the sliced baguette on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until crispy.
7. Once the soup is done simmering, remove the bay leaf and thyme sprig.
8. Ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls. Place a slice of toasted baguette on top of each bowl of soup and sprinkle grated Gruyere cheese over the bread.
9. Place the bowls on a baking sheet and put them under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Enjoy your delicious onion soup!

947517898504,"After taking a short leave of absence to run a highly specialized (and highly lucrative) paintball retreat for Fortune 500 companies, Wolf grew tired of teaching fat, middle-aged men how to pretend to kill each other. Especially exhausting was the week-long minicamp ""Oh-Dark-Dirty"" where he attempted to instruct them in Night Operations concepts and tactics while making sure everyone was wearing safety orange. He reports he's ready and very eager to return to mercenary work. One of A.I.M.'s most well-rounded members, Sanderson is highly sought after by clients looking for a merc who is capable of doing everything and is willing to do anything. Best to hire him as soon as he's available because he surely won't be without a contract for long!",,,UnitDataCompositeDef Wolf Bio
